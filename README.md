# Thresher
The mod that all modpack developers should wish for!
It has one simple feature: To let players know if their PC/settings don't meet the specifications you wish they did.
If they don't meet your recommended specifications, it shows a screen that lets them know not to blame you if their game crashes.

### Configuration
Very simple, it simply saves the configuration to `config/thresher.properties`.
Current configuration options:
1. minimumDedicatedRAM: Amount of RAM you wish the user to have allocated.

### Plans
If it is requested, I may make it possible to throw a warning for CPU capabilities.
As always with my mods, if you wish to request something, put it on the issue tracker.
